    <p>I was looking for the drivers for an Acer One 10 S1002, even if you don't have that model, maybe it will still work.</p>
    <p>I'm still upset that Acer removed their drivers from their website.</p>
    <p>Some windows tablets (like the Acer One 10) use baytrail.</p>
    <p>I found the drives after hours of searching.<h2>You can download them <a href="https://archive.org/details/universal-oem-baytrail-drivers">here</a></h2><p>
